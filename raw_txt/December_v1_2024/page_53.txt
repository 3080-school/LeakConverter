            "A. The SEBS rubber sample used in the 2019 study was thicker than the dimethicone sample.",
            "B. Twisting an object will generally cause its temperature to increase, a process known as torsional heating.",
            "C. When the fibers were twisted as part of the 2019 study, the surface temperature of both samples increased.",
            "D. In 2019, researchers studied the effect of torsional heating on various fibers, including samples of SEBS rubber and dimethicone."
