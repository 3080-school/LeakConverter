In a 2022 study, researchers proposed that Saturn was once orbited by a large moon they named Chrysalis. Their simulations indicated that Chrysalis would likely have come very close to Saturn around 160 million years ago. At that distance, Chrysalis would have been broken apart by tidal forces. The researchers hypothesized that the resulting debris formed Saturn’s rings.",
