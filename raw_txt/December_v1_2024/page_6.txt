Mariana Candido and other Africanist scholars have shown, however, that in parts of Africa, centrally administered industrial production, the legal treatment of land as private property, and other features of capitalism predated colonization. One reason for this discrepancy is that historians of capitalism tend to focus on longitudinal economic data drawn from archival records, which do not exist for much of precolonial Africa.",
