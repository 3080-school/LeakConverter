But petroleum extraction is a very carbon-intensive industry, so as social attitudes increasingly favor using less carbon-intensive sources of energy, demand for petroleum falls and the drilling equipment will eventually, or even suddenly, become a liability as reduced petroleum prices make it more difficult to recover the expense of maintaining such equipment.",
