Kunc found in a 2015 study of zebra cichlids. Researchers conducted a meta-analysis of studies of how such noise affects animals and found that, for every study, relevant traits or behaviors of the animals were observably different between the exposed group and the otherwise similar but unexposed group. Although, on average, studies of fish showed larger differences than studies of birds did, for every class of animals examined, there were individual studies showing differences well above the average for fish. Therefore, the results of the meta-analysis suggest that _____",
