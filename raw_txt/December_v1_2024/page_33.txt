While horizontal gene transfer is common among prokaryotes—single-celled organisms, such as the bacteria Brevibacillus borstelensis and Lactococcus lactis—it has rarely been observed among eukaryotes (multicellular organisms). However, new studies suggest that horizontal gene transfer is more common in eukaryotes than originally thought.",
