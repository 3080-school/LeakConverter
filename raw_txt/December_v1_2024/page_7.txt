I am by no means sure that if the good people of Milby had known the truth about the Countess Czerlaski, they would not have been considerably disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they imagined. Nice distinctions are troublesome. It is so much easier to make up your mind that your neighbour is good for nothing, than to enter into all the circumstances that would oblige you to modify that opinion.",

            "C. To explain why the people of Milby are somewhat correct to reproach the Countess Czerlaski for her misdeeds",
            "D. To engage the reader’s compassion for both the Countess Czerlaski and the people of Milby by detailing their different viewpoints"
