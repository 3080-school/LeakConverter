Among studies of nonhuman primates, James Welles’s 1976 study of captive chimpanzees and catarrhine monkeys reported more right-handed individuals than left-handed ones, but William C. McGrew and colleagues’ 1999 study of wild chimpanzees did not find a tendency toward right-handedness. It’s important to note, however, that captive animals spend significantly more time with humans than wild animals do, and therefore _____",
