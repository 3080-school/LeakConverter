Sir Thomas Malory's 15th-century text Le Morte d’Arthur was an attempt to compile these stories into a coherent narrative. Many of Malory’s sources derive from Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of the Kings of Britain, written in the 1130s. While neither History nor any works that predate it mention Arthur’s famous Round Table at which his knights assembled, Le Morte d’Arthur does, suggesting that",
