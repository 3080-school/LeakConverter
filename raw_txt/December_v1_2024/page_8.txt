A salon is a social gathering for the exploration of intellectual ideas.\n\nIt was evening when the two men got up to leave. Tía Ana had already come into the room several times to see if these guests had departed yet. The front parlor had always been her special province, as she used it for her little school. Now, every evening, it turned into Salomé’s salon, as Ramona called it, and it was never in order for its transformation back to a classroom the following morning.",

            "C. She is impatient to share her plans to start a new school with the guests and hopes they will support her.",
            "D. She finds the guests to be dull and is eager to find a way to leave the salon."
