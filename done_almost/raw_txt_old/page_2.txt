Researchers Youran Fu and Marshall Fisher have found that combining sellers' own data with information gathered from social media can dramatically improve the accuracy of such forecasts by 24 to 57 percent in the cases they directly studied. Better predictions mean demand is easier to meet without retailers becoming overstocked.",
