        "question": "In 2023 literary scholar Jeremy Douglass cautioned technology investors and enthusiasts who predict conventional books' ultimate displacement by newer forms of media. Douglass observed that the concept of an 'interactive' text is much older than technologists assume, extending back to the first time readers scratched notes into a text's margins. In addition, newer media, such as video games, haven't replaced older forms of entertainment, such as comic books, but rather exist alongside them. Douglass believes that rather than supplanting books, technology is simply making new forms of expression possible.",
